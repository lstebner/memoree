# Memoree

The classic game of Memory. 

## Explain yourself

No.

Fine. Sometimes I just want to build something for kicks and lately I've been learning Japanese so tools around that have been related to my ultimate goal. This is another one. 

The game of memory is probably known to everyone, but I haven't been a little kid for awhile so maybe not. The concept is very simple. A bunch of cards/tiles are created with words (or pictures/sounds/etc) on them and you flip them over in pairs. You have to match them all up, but you can only have two flipped at a time. The bigger the grid, the more challenging it becomes.

This is an HTML/JavaScript version of that. It will have some basic modes for playing and improving your brain but also some modes for learning Japanese words for the reasons above. 

I'll write more about this later, but that's all for now. Enjoy!
